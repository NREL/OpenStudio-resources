# This file aims to test the PlantEquipmentOperation based on the difference
# between outdoor conditions and a reference node:
# OutdoorDryBulbDifference, OutdoorDewpointDifference and OutdoorWetBulbDifference
# These three mostly apply to condenser equipment, but in order to not
# duplicate tests unceserarilly, I will apply some to chiller/boiler loops

# NOTE: All of these delta temp schemes compare based on
# (Node condition - Outdoor condition)
# Meaning if a range from 0 to 5 degC difference, means OA condition is between
# 0 to 5 LOWER than the node
# They also all expect a WATER node as the reference temperature node
# (so you can't pass model.outdoorAirNode for eg)
